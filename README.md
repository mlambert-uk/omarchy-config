# ZOMBIE configuration for Omarchy
This is my customisations to the standard Omarchy install to personalise it to my liking.

This project requires a clean install of Omarchy before running.

**PLEASE NOTE** - Running this script **WILL** make significant changes to your install.  Do so at your own risk.  It is recommended you try
this configuration out on a VM prior to installing on any production system

## Omarchy
To install Omarchy, please visit the [Omarchy website](https://omarchy.org) and follow the installation instructions in the [Omarchy manual](https://learn.omacom.io/2/the-omarchy-manual).

## Install the ZOMBIE configuration
git clone this project into a folder on your machine

run the zombie_install.sh script in your home directory.

Once the installation has completed, please reboot your system as several Environment variables will be changed by the script.

Enjoy!
